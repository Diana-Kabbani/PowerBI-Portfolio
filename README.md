## Adventure Works

Project-based course on Udemy (Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence) that allowed me to have a practical, hands-on experience with Power BI Desktop. 
### <ins>The Context</ins>

Adventure Works Cycles (globl manufacturing company) hired me to design and deliver business intelligence solutions to them from scratch. The client wants to have a view of
their main KPIs which are **sales, revenue, profit and returns** through three glances: 
1. A comparison of **regional performances**.
2. A **product-level** analysis to identify product trends.
3. A **customer-level** analysis to identify the high-value customers.

To do so, the client provided raw CSV files (transactions, returns, products customers and territories)

### <ins>The Project</ins>
Four steps were involved in the creation of this report: 
1. **Data Shaping**: Connecting to the several raw data sources and transforming them using **PowerQuery**
2. **Data Modeling**: Building a relational data model using table relationships
3. Creating **calculated columns** as well as **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) measures
4. Finally, designing an **interactive report** to visualize the data.
